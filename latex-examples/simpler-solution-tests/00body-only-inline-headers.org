\input{header.tex}

This is a test.

* let us see how this handles sections
  :PROPERTIES:
  :EXPORT_HUGO_WEIGHT: 0
  :END:

abla

** and subsections
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EXPORT_HUGO_WEIGHT: 1
   :END:

cadabla.

* THis section should appear
  :PROPERTIES:
  :EXPORT_HUGO_WEIGHT: 2
  :END:

but the next section should not appear because it is commented.

!!!!!Ïˆ

\input{footer.tex}

* COMMENT A commented sectiona
  :PROPERTIES:
  :EXPORT_HUGO_WEIGHT: 3
  :END:

and its commmented contents.

** and its commented subsection.
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EXPORT_HUGO_WEIGHT: 4
   :END:

and the commented subsections comments.

* COMMENT ALWAYS PUT THE input footer statement at the end of the last UNCOMMENTED Section
  :PROPERTIES:
  :EXPORT_HUGO_WEIGHT: 5
  :END:

Because otherwise we lose the input statement at the end for the footer.
