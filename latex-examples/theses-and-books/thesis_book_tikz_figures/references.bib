	abstract = {AC distributed power systems (DPS) can be found in several new and emerging applications. Similar to dc distributed power systems, an ac DPS relies on power electronics and control to realize its functions and achieve the required performance. System stability and power quality are important issues in both types of systems due to the complex system behavior resulted from active control at both the source and the load side. Traditional small-signal analysis methods cannot be directly applied to an ac DPS because of the periodically time-varying system operation trajectory. Possible solutions to this problem include transformation into a rotating (dq) reference frame, modeling using dynamic phasors, reduced-order modeling, and harmonic linearization. This paper reviews these small-signal methods and discusses their utilities as well as limitations. Compatibility of each type of models with state-space and impedance-based system analysis approaches will also be discussed. Problems related to the linearization of phasor-based models and their use in impedance-based system analysis are highlighted in particular.},

The proposed EHD WTG model includes both electrical and mechanical subsystems and permits monitoring step-by-step the harmonics time variation; this allows, among other applications, to detect contingency scenarios, such as resonance problems caused by a specific harmonic. Moreover, control efficiency can be improved by means of the power-quality indices which are instantaneously available by the EHD WTG model. The proposed model is capable of accounting for an arbitrary number of harmonics; however, the more harmonics that are included, the larger the system becomes. This affects the central-processing unit time by the transient simulation. An efficient heuristic remedy is proposed in this paper which consists of accounting for “high-impact” harmonics only, based on the converter's frequency spectrum.

Several methods like impedance based analysis, which are derived from the conventional average model, are introduced to perform research about the harmonic interaction. However, it is found that the Linear Time Invariant (LTI) based model analysis makes it difficult to analyze these phenomena because of the time-varying properties of the power electronic based systems. This paper investigates grid-connected converter by using the Harmonic State Space (HSS) small signal model, which is based on a Linear Time-varying Periodically (LTP) theory. The proposed model can include the switching behavior of the model, where it makes the model possible to analyze how harmonics are transferred into both the ac-side and dc-side circuits. Furthermore, a harmonic matrix of the grid-connected converter is developed to analyze the harmonic interaction at the steady-state behavior. Besides, the frequency-domain results are compared with time-domain simulation results by using HSS modeling to verify the theoretical analysis. Experimental results are finally discussed to verify the proposed model and study.},

Then, a new parametric DP (PDP) model of LCRs is proposed, wherein the DP dynamics of rectifier/dc-link are represented using a set of explicit algebraic functions that are numerically established. Rigorous computer studies demonstrate that the proposed PDP methodology is capable of accurately predicting the steady-state and transient responses of LCR systems under a wide range of loading conditions, while providing significant computational advantages over the conventional detailed model and the established ADP models.},

The model is derived in rotating dq coordinate frame, and the coordinate frame at double the fundamental frequency, in steady-state. A substantial analytical basis is presented in order to facilitate direct mathematical manipulations of non-linear terms in the rotating frame. An 8th order model is firstly derived which includes circulating current representation. Later, the circulating current suppression controller (CCSC) is modelled and the magnitude of second harmonic control inputs is studied. The final model for MMC with CCSC is given in a simple and convenient form for power flow studies. The accuracy of the proposed models is verified against a detailed dynamic MMC benchmark model in PSCAD. Finally, a comparison between the MMC model and 2-level VSC model is given.},

Traditionally, utility electric power systems (EPS–grid or utility grid) were not designed to accommodate active generation and storage at the distribution level. As a result, there are major issues and obstacles to an orderly transition to using and integrating distributed power resources with the grid. The lack of uniform national interconnection standards and tests for interconnection operation and certification, as well as the lack of uniform national building, electrical, and safety codes, are understood. IEEE Std 1547 and its development demonstrate a model for ongoing success in establishing additional interconnection agreements, rules, and standards, on a national, regional, and state level. IEEE Std 1547 has the potential to be used in federal legislation and rule making and state public utilities commission (PUC) deliberations, and by over 3000 utilities in formulating technical requirements for interconnection agreements for distributed generators powering the electric grid. This standard focuses on the technical specifications for, and testing of, the interconnection itself. It provides requirements relevant to the performance, operation, testing, safety considerations, and maintenance of the interconnection. It includes general requirements, response to abnormal conditions, power quality, islanding, and test specifications and requirements for design, production, installation evaluation, commissioning, and periodic tests. The stated requirements are universally needed for interconnection of distributed resources (DR), including synchronous machines, induction machines, or power inverters/converters and will be sufficient for most installations.},

	abstract = {This thesis describes the development of several small signal analysis methods for the  modelling of power electronic converters. The methods are written generally and are  intended to be able to be applied to all converter classes. In the penultimate chapter these  general models are used to model the capacitor commutated converter.  All the contained methods are based around a time domain small signal model. This time  domain small model is a linearization of a power electronic system of passive components  and ideal switches described as a hybrid system. The key problem in the derivation of the  small signal model is the correct determination and description of the linearized effect of  switching instant variation.  Three analysis methods based upon the small signal model are advanced in this thesis,  these are; time domain sensitivity matrices for use in a Newton determination of the cyclic  steady state of a power electronic converter, partial waveform construction of harmonic  sensitivity matrices for studying sensitivity of converters to harmonic disturbances, and  harmonic state space models also for the construction of harmonic sensitivity matrices  and for study of dynamic systems. Each modelling technique is applied to the more  common converter topologies of the Buck-Boost converter and the Graetz Bridge before  being finally applied to the capacitor commutated converter. Each technique is compared  to PSCAD-EMTDC simulations for verification.},

The most direct strategy to regulate such currents is to use a simple closed loop proportional-integral (PI) regulator, which has no theoretical stability limits as the proportional and integral gains are increased, since it is only a second order system. However, pulsewidth modulation (PWM) transport and controller sampling delays limit the gain values that can be achieved in practical systems. Taking these limitations into account, this paper presents an analytical method to determine the best possible gains that can be achieved for any class of practical linear AC current controller. The analysis shows that the maximum possible proportional gain is determined by the plant series inductance, the DC bus voltage and the transport and sampling delays, while the maximum possible integral gain is determined primarily by the transport and sampling delays. The work is applicable to stationary frame PI regulators, stationary frame controllers with back electromotive force compensation, stationary frame P+ resonant (PR) controllers, and synchronous d- q frame controllers, since they all have identical proportional and integral gains that must be optimized for any particular application.},

Multi-level wind power converters have many power semiconductors, whose power losses and reliability have great significances to the converters' efficiency and reliability. In this paper, an optimized design for multi-MW wind power converter based on efficiency and reliability is proposed. In the proposed optimized design, the high voltage IGBTs that are switched at high frequency, are replaced by serial lower voltage rating ones to reduce their power losses. The serial application of IGBTs can also increase the switching frequency of IGBTs while reducing the power losses. The increase of switching frequency can also bring many benefits. On the other side, the serial IGBTs can also improve power semiconductor's reliability, which can, as a result, improve wind power converter's reliability.

A major advantage of the proposed controller is emulating the behavior of synchronous machines (SMs) with proper regulation of dc-link voltage which eases integration of VSCs interfacing distributed and renewable generation units into ac systems in the presence of conventional SMs. A cascaded frequency, angle and virtual torque control topology is developed to emulate the mechanical behavior of an SM which offers synchronization power to eliminate the need for a phase-locked-loop after initial converter synchronization, and damping power dynamics to damp power oscillations; and presents frequency dynamics similar to SMs, thus it introduces some inertia to the grid. The controller presents high stability margin and fast dc-link voltage regulation, whereas it can provide frequency support in the ac-side during contingencies. Frequency and voltage amplitude are adjusted by two separate loops. Two different variants are proposed for dc-link voltage control; namely direct dc-link voltage control and indirect dc-link voltage control via a dc-link voltage controller. Small-signal dynamics, analysis, and design process are presented. Both simulation and experimental results are provided to validate the controller effectiveness.},

This standard sets requirements for harmonic performance, which are particularly relevant when converter interfaced DRs are considered. Specifically, the standard limits the allowable harmonic current injected by a DR, assuming grid voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC) is harmonic free. In this paper it is demonstrated, both mathematically and experimentally, that the harmonic current injection of a converter interfaced DR depends highly on the level of PCC background voltage. The paper presents a mathematical formulation that enables the impact of PCC voltage harmonics on the harmonic current injection of a converter interfaced DR to be determined via experimental identification of the converters Frequency Coupling Matrix (FCM). Experimental tests show that an IEEE 1547 compliant solar inverter with measured TDD of 0.66\% for an undistorted PCC can produce TDD levels in excess of 20\% in the presence of 3\% voltage distortion. It is concluded that TDD metrics, as employed in IEEE Std. 1547, provide little insight into the field performance of converter interfaced DRs when background voltage harmonics are present. Improved FCM-based metrics for assessing harmonic performance of converter interfaced DRs in presence of voltage harmonics are provided.},

This hybrid controller, called "modulated hysteresis" controller, combines in one hand the robustness properties of a hysteresis controller and on the other hand the zero static error of a linear PI controller. In addition it allows the fixed frequency operation of the converter. To model the proposed non-linear current controller, different tools are developed. In a first step, a high frequency average model to study the average dynamic properties (bandwidth, time response, overflow) is proposed. To investigate the behavior of the current ripple due to the switching effect, a second model, based on the construction of a three-dimensional bifurcation diagram and the definition of a form function, is developed. It allows determining the nature of each cycle by studying the state trajectory during the corresponding switching period. Design rules of the parameters of this hybrid non-linear current controller are explained and its robustness properties are tested by numerical simulation and experimentation},

Shaping of the inverter output impedance is achieved through changes to various inverter control functions, including grid synchronization and current control. The trade-off between grid compatibility and inverter control performance is also discussed. Experimental results from a multi-converter system test-bed are presented to validate the analyses.},

The absence of a substantial level of energy stored in such power-electronics-based systems results in fast system dynamics, governed by electromagnetic phenomena. Moreover, interactions between converters are largely influenced by the control parameters and, in general, an a priori identification of interaction modes based on associated time constants is less straightforward than in ac systems. Furthermore, the extent to which converters interact not only depends on the controller parameters, but is also influenced by the physical characteristics of the HVDC system. The methodology introduced in this paper is based on aggregated participation factors to distinguish between local modes, primarily associated with one terminal, and interaction modes involving multiple terminals. To illustrate the proposed methodology, the influence of droop control parameters, as well as dc breaker inductors, on the system dynamics and the participation of the terminals in system interactions are investigated for a three-terminal MTDC system.},

This results in deteriorating the system operating performances. On the basis of the proposed modelling, the linearisation of the hysteresis control for the HAPF is firstly studied, investigated and compared with the linear active power filter. Two limits are proposed in this study that divides the HAPF into non-linear, quasi-linear and linear operation regions. The design criteria of hysteresis band and sampling time can then be derived. Single-phase simulation and experimental results are given to verify the hysteresis control study of HAPF compared with active power filter.

The first is based on solving the state space equations during the switching period, which yields a discrete model that depends on the single-edge or double-edge type of PWM model. The second approach is the based on the continuous model of the inverter, which is derived from measurements of the real inverter and its discretisation. Both models should regard the increase in the real value of the equivalent coil series resistance and changes in the filter coil inductance with the frequency and amplitude of the magnetising current. The design of the control system requires experimental estimation of the additional delays, which are outside of the models during the measurements and modelling. Both models are validated by comparing the closed-loop systems with the simple instantaneous controllers in the experimental model.},

They are the mitigation of phase lag experienced by a conventional damper and the avoidance of instability caused by the negative resistance inserted unintentionally. Moreover, with the virtual RC damper, the frequency region, within which the harmonic compensation is effective, can be extended beyond the gain crossover frequency.

	abstract = {With silicon carbide (SiC) devices increasing in commercial availability, high switching frequency is becoming a general trend to increase the power density of power converters. High switching frequency operation nonetheless exacerbates EMI emissions in a system, for which accurate EMI models of power converters are needed to predict noise and aid in the design of their EMI filters. Accordingly, this paper assesses the effect on the EMI emissions from a higher switching frequency and evaluates the newly proposed unterminated behavioral model (UBM), which can predict the CM noise of power converters in the conducted EMI frequency range using equivalent noise sources and impedances by assessing its capability to predict the EMI noise of high switching frequency SiC power converters. The results obtained show that under high switching frequency, the input and output current spectrum shifts towards the MHz range, which is effectively captured by the equivalent noise sources of the UBM. A high-pass filter can be applied to capture the noise above the system noise floor, ultimately favoring the UBM prediction capacity extending to the whole conducted EMI range. Experimental results of a 3 kW, 300 V DC, SiC three-phase inverter switching at 20-70 kHz are used to demonstrate these findings and validate the analysis conducted.},

The major problem in using solar PV system is its instability and dependence of output energy. In order to stabilize the energy output and to get the smoothened profile, the power converter must be connected to the output of the PV panel. For this purpose the modular multilevel converter (MMC) is considered in this work. Moreover the system will not require a line frequency transformer due to the high voltage and high power capacity of MMC. The modular multilevel converter is considered due to this high efficiency and low harmonic distortion. The filters are connected between the converter and network to make the system efficient with no oscillation at the output side. The switching loss and total harmonic distortion (THD) is analyzed for different frequency. The simulation is carried out using MatLab and the results are presented.

Besides evaluating the performance space and, hence, potential application space for GaN CAVETs, this paper presents significant accomplishment in establishing a device to circuit model, thereby, offering a reliable method of evaluating GaN-based power transistors.

The model was successfully applied to compare SiC MOSFETs with GaN CAVETs. A cascoded GaN CAVET has \$2times \$ faster switching time, \$3times \$ lower switching loss compared with standard commercial SiC MOSFET, owing to the higher electron mobility in GaN.

Hybrid filter topology can be used to compensate harmonic currents, as well as for power factor corrections, without concern for importing and exporting harmonics, or simply the series and parallel resonance that may occur. The new trend in harmonic power filter design is not to obtain the best solution from a single objective optimization but to obtain a good compromise solution accomplished under other conflicting objectives. Fortran Feasible Sequential Quadratic Programming is used to determine the proposed filter optimal sizing to minimize the total voltage harmonic distortion as the main objective function, where maintaining the load power factor at an acceptable limit is desired. If the total harmonic voltage distortion achieves the specified goal, then the objective is redirected into minimizing the resultant voltage and current total harmonic distortions.

	abstract = {High-order passive filters, such as the well-known LCL filters, are normally employed in the grid-connected power conversion systems to effectively attenuate the switching frequency harmonic introduced by the modulation of power converters. Although much more compact than the conventional single-inductor L filters, such passive filters are still bulky and expensive when compared with their active counterparts, e.g., the semiconductor switches. In order to improve the system power density and reduce its cost, the magnetic integration technique has been widely adopted so that the discrete inductors of passive filters are replaced by the integrated inductor, resulting in smaller magnetic cores and therefore the decreased volumes of passive filters. For conventional magnetic integrated LCL filters, the converter-side inductor and grid-side inductor are integrated together and their coupling coefficient is intentionally minimized. In this letter, this coupling coefficient is fully utilized and properly designed, and the resulting coupling effect is equivalent to inserting an additional inductor into the filter capacitor branch-loop. The integrated inductor and the filter capacitor can form an integrated LLCL filter, which exhibits the advantages of both the LLCL filter and magnetic integration, e.g., enhanced harmonic attenuation, reduced filter inductances and system volume without adding the extra trap inductor. Finally, experimental results obtained from a single-phase grid-connected voltage-source converter interfaced by the proposed integrated filter are presented to validate its effectiveness.},

	abstract = {With increasing share of the intermittent renewable energy resources in the grid, battery energy storage systems (BESS) are becoming increasingly important for the primary reserve. One possible way to connect such large BESS to the existing ac grids is by using medium-voltage (MV) multi-megawatt voltage-source converters (VSC). In these grid-connected converters, an LCL filter is often used to comply with the grid code requirements of low harmonic content. The semiconductor devices used at these power and voltage levels can be switched only at fairly low switching frequencies because of the excessive switching loss. Operation at low switching frequency leads to control problems such as low phase margin of the current-control loop (CCL) because of the delay incurred by the digital implementation of the modulator which might lead to system instability. This issue is discussed in detail in this work using the double-sided Frequency Response Function (FRF) bode plots of the CCL. Active and passive damping of the LCL resonance is also discussed. An optimized variant of the discontinuous space-vector modulation based on a previous work is adapted to increase the switching frequency while maintaining the overall system efficiency. Consequently, the required LCL-filter size is reduced to one half, thus saving significant amounts of copper and steel.},

	abstract = {LCL filter is the common interface between the Pulse Width Modulated Voltage Source Converter (PWM VSC) and the utility grid due to high harmonic attenuation capability and reduced size of the passive elements. The present paper investigates the most promising passive damping methods for the LCL topology but also propose an overview of high order filters capable to offer even more attenuation than the LCL filter at a reduced size. This is the case of more recently introduced LCL topology with tuned traps. However, it is shown that by decreasing the size of the passive elements the robustness of the filter also is decreased. Thus, a comparison of the filter features including the robustness towards grid impedance variation, harmonic attenuation capability and losses in the damping circuit became interesting from a practical implementation point of view. The design of the proposed filters is validated by simulation and experimental results and covers two scenarios: high and low/medium power applications.},

However, the filter resonance peaks may require the use of passive dampers to stabilize the interactions between the load and source impedances. Furthermore, the stabilizing effect is more difficult to be guaranteed for cost-optimized filters, which are characterized by low-inductance and high-capacitance passive components. In this paper, several passive filter topologies used to interface voltage-source converters with the utility grid are reviewed and evaluated in terms of damping capability, stored energy in the passive components, and power loss in the damping circuit. In addition, the influences of different switching frequencies of power converters on the passive filter design are discussed in the range 1-15 kHz. Illustrative design examples of the passive filters and experimental data are also provided.},

	abstract = {A shunt active power filter (APF) comprising of pulse-width modulation (PWM) based voltage–source inverter (VSI) is presented in this paper, because it has grabbed tremendous attention as a promising power conditioner. However, it involves huge power loss due to the presence of inductors and semiconductor switching devices, resulting in deterioration of APF performance. So, a Proportional–Integral (PI) controller has been used to minimize this undesirable power loss by regulating the dc-link voltage of VSI. Conventional linearized tuning of PI controller gains does not yield satisfactory results for a range of operating conditions due to the complex, non-linear and time-varying nature of power system networks. The goal of this paper is to find out optimized values of PI controller gains by the implementation of optimization techniques. Developed by hybridization of Particle swarm optimization (PSO) and Bacterial foraging optimization (BFO), an Enhanced BFO technique is presented in this paper so as to overcome the drawbacks in both PSO and BFO, and accelerate the convergence of optimization problem. Comparative evaluation of PSO, BFO and Enhanced BFO has been carried out with regard to compensation of harmonics in source current in a three-phase three-wire system. Extensive MATLAB simulations followed by real-time performance analysis in Opal-RT Lab simulator validate that, the APF employing Enhanced BFO gives superior load compensation compared to the other alternatives, under a range of supply and sudden load change conditions. It drastically lowers down the source current total harmonic distortion (THD), thereby satisfying the IEEE-519 standard recommendations on harmonic limits.},

The forgetting factor for minimizing the error function used in this algorithm is tuned iteratively to provide faster convergence and better accuracy in the estimation process. The proposed algorithm is particularly suitable for the integration of distributed generating sources to micro grids, when fast detection of faults and islanding condition is required.

The system is represented through its port controlled Hamiltonian model, and the controller is designed by interconnection and damping assignment. This design method allows an intuitive way to remove the undesired couplings between system dynamics while assigning the damping required to achieve the expected convergence rate. The proposed controller allows a direct control of the DC link voltage by proper selection of the controller parameters. Moreover, an integral action is added to the proposed controller in order to eliminate the steady-state error in the system variables.

A novel approach based on an improved instantaneous active and reactive current component method is proposed. The performance of the proposed control strategy has been compared with instantaneous reactive power theory, symmetrical component theory and dq theory. SAF has been realized by three-phase voltage source converter. Reference currents generated by control strategies has been tracked by a SAF in a hysteresis band control scheme. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated in terms of reactive power compensation, reduction in magnitude of source currents, compensator currents, and harmonic compensation as per IEEE-519 standard. To ascertain the viability of the proposed control algorithm, the performance is evaluated under different source voltage conditions with the IEEE Standard-1459 power definitions. Variation in magnitude as well as harmonic content of source voltage has been considered. Under balanced sinusoidal source voltage condition, all control strategies congregate to similar results. Under unbalanced sinusoidal source voltage condition, dq theory and proposed theory have shown similar performance. However, under distorted source voltage conditions, an improved instantaneous active and reactive current component theory presents superior performance. A three-phase, three-wire distribution system supplying non-linear load is considered for simulation study. Simulation results from a complete model of SAF are presented to validate and compare the control strategies.},

As a matter of fact, this approach can relax the computational burden for solving the HJ equation. Simulation results regarding spacecraft attitude stabilization with comparisons among the VSRCs and the LQR reliable designs are also given.

The goal is to minimize big investments and operational expenses in new off-shore production units by utilizing existing production units as a hub and have a significant part of the gas recompression equipment installed on the sea-bed by means of long step-out cables. This paper is predominantly focusing on the design and testing of a High-speed Variable Speed Drive (VSD) \& long step-out power system at the customer's Technology Laboratory K-Lab in Karsto, Norway. Hereby, several technical challenges will be addressed: 1. World longest umbilical cable length between frequency converter and machine/compressor of up to 47 km. 2. Biggest power rating for step-out system so far, rated for 6-8MW compressor power. 3. Highest motor supply frequencies of up to 200 Hz 4. Design and qualification of oil filled transformers (both topside and subsea) for rating up to 15 MVA, voltage up to 72,5 kV and supply frequencies up to 200 Hz The paper will also present measurement results of the high-speed VSD system, which recently has successfully been put into operation in the K-Lab in order to qualify several machine/compressor solutions.},

An elementary hysteresis operator is constructed to describe the hysteresis information, which is used with a Neural Network to represent the static nonlinear part of the PEA.

This Hammerstein model is able to describe the rate-dependent hysteresis behaviors between 1Hz and 100 Hz well.

The proposed control technique retains the benefit of the hysteresis control having fast dynamic response and tackles the drawback of the standard hysteresis control having variable switching frequency. The concept is based on predicting the current reference, system dynamic behavior, and past time to formulate the switching function for dictating the switching times of the switches in the inverter within a predefined switching period. Of particular importance, no hysteresis bandwidth (a challenge in the practical implementation) is needed in the entire control method. The operating principles of the proposed technique and mathematical derivation of the switching functions will be given. The proposed method is successfully applied to a 300 W, 110 V, 60 Hz grid-connected VSI prototype with the controller implemented by a simple analog circuit. The steady-state and large-signal dynamic response of the VSI are studied. Experimental results show that the inverter can reach the steady state in two switching actions after the inverter is subject to large-signal input and output disturbances.},

The conventional implicit MPC requires a large number of computations, whereas explicit MPC cannot directly incorporate real-time changes in model parameters, while still being computationally expensive than some of the other control schemes, e.g., hysteresis, dead beat control, etc. In this paper, we propose a new approach to solve the optimization problem in implicit MPC that has a computational complexity approximately five times less than that of explicit MPC.

One of the technical challenges is how to fast and accurately estimate the grid impedance, even under the distorted and unbalanced conditions. Many impedance estimation methods have been presented in the past decades. Most of them intentionally inject one or more disturbance signals, low frequency or high frequency, to excite the grid response. And then the grid impedance can be estimated by the voltage/current information of two steady-state operating points before and after the disturbance. However, these injected disturbances will deteriorate the power quality. In order to mitigate the problem, a new impedance estimation method is presented in this paper. Its basic idea lies in the inherent switching feature of the grid-connected power converter. Therefore, the grid impedance can be easily estimated with no need of the intentionally injected disturbance signals anymore. The theoretical analysis and performance evaluation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

On the other hand, the LC resonant frequencies in both current-source rectifier (CSR) and voltage-source rectifier (VSR) systems with input LC filter circuits are relatively fixed due to the small variation range of source impedance.

For this purpose, a novel design algorithm that takes switching frequency, capacity factor, modulation index, PWM scheme(s), and converter topology(ies) as input is unveiled to provide the design steps and performance benchmark for the specified topologies and modulation methods. Design of the LCL filter is also addressed, and equivalent output ripple performance criteria is used to benchmark the converter performances for a set of selected filter parameters. Main contribution of this algorithm is that it covers cost and operating factors of the design during the hardware design phase by introducing/modifying the terms of total cost of ownership (TCO) and return on investment (ROI) time considering the major energy markets. The design is detailed for 1-MVA system, and the results are summarized for 0.5 and 2-MVA systems. The study shows that 3L topologies perform more efficiently than 2L-VSC (T-type being the most prominent-with the shortest ROI), whereas the difference becomes much more prominent at the multimegawatt range, provided that all three yield equivalent outputs fulfilling the stringent grid codes.},

In this paper, a synchronous reference-frame-based analysis is presented to estimate the grid current distortion in interleaved grid-connected converters with unequal terminal voltages. Influence of carrier interleaving angle on rms grid current ripple is studied theoretically as well as experimentally. Optimum interleaving angle to minimize the rms grid current ripple is investigated for different applications of parallel converters. The applications include unity power factor rectifiers, inverters for renewable energy sources, reactive power compensators, and circulating-power test setup used for thermal testing of high-power converters. Optimum interleaving angle is shown to be a strong function of the average of the modulation indices of the two converters, irrespective of the application. The findings are verified experimentally on two parallel-connected converters, with a circulating reactive power of up to 150 kVA between them.},

In this scheme, local information is used by each inverter to achieve the required current control with minimal information sharing between the converters. Unlike conventional current sharing control methods that use a stationary or rotating reference frame representation, the converter currents in the proposed controller are represented by the magnitude of the current space vector. As a result, each converter employs only one proportional-integral compensator to share the load current. The operation of the new current sharing control scheme is demonstrated using two different pulsewidth modulation (PWM) control strategies: conventional space-vector PWM and discontinuous PWM. A mathematical analysis of the proposed control scheme is presented, and the performance of the controller is experimentally verified using a 2.5-kVA test rig.

	abstract = {A nonlinear discrete-time model along with an optimal stabilizing controller using a unified power quality conditioner (UPQC) is proposed for weak/islanded grids in this paper. An advanced stabilizing controller greatly benefits islanded medium-sized grid and microgrid due to their relatively small stored energy levels, which adversely affect their stability, as opposed to larger grids. In addition, a discrete-time grid model and controller are preferred for digital implementation. Here, the discrete-time Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs optimal control method is employed to design an optimal grid stabilizer. While UPQC is conventionally utilized for power quality improvement in distribution systems in the presence of renewable energy, here, the stabilizing control is added and applied to the UPQC series voltage in order to mitigate the grid's oscillations besides UPQC's power conditioning tasks. Consequently, the UPQC can be employed to stabilize a grid-tie inverter (GTI) or a synchronous generator (SG) with minimum control effort. When controlling the GTI associated with renewable energy sources, a reduced UPQC structure is proposed that only employs the series compensator. Next, a successive approximation method along with neural networks is utilized to approximate a cost function of the grid dynamical states, the UPQC control parameters, and disturbance, in a two-player zero-sum game with the players being UPQC control and grid disturbances. Subsequently, the cost function is used to obtain the nonlinear optimal controller that is applied to the UPQC. Simulation results show effective damping behavior of the proposed nonlinear controller in controlling both GTI and SG in weak and islanded grids.},

	abstract = {Dynamic loads of high capacity power grids under normal and severe conditions are the most concerns of system operators and dispatchers to maintain voltage stability. Reactive power (Q) are often drawn by loads from various generated sources disturbing the operational power factor. Compensating methods are used, depending on load types and their reactive power patterns, to continuously monitor and correctly counteract fast changes by extremely rapid VAR compensation especially during transient conditions. Using power electronics and combining both, power and control engineering, some FACTS devises equipped with selected power electronic switching are the appropriate methods to respond to system variations in almost no time. STATCOM regulates system voltages based on a voltage-source converters, by absorbing or generating reactive power. Contrary to a thyristor-based Static VAR Compensator (SVC), STATCOM output current (inductive or capacitive) can be controlled independent of the system voltage. This paper presents a design of voltage controller to analyze and validate the dynamic behavior of FACTS device (STATCOM)in riding through severe transient imbalance using a powerful computer simulation application “PSCAD EMTDC”. The STATCOM was modeled in 3-Phase network with various parameters in a steady state condition and during a short interval of system fault. The regulator provided the ride through during severe transient while maintaining sufficient bandwidth to perform necessary compensations. The controller behavior is simulated in distribution system model while it was subjected to severe three phases to ground fault with rapidly varying three phase load.},

	abstract = {The paper addresses the problem of predictive diagnostic in uninterruptible power supply systems (UPS) for railway. A new UPS for railway applications is proposed. A FMECA (Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis) analysis carried out on it shows that key issues for the system reliability are the faults occurring in the 3-phase high power transformers and in the battery modules used for energy storage. While at state of art several works address the battery failure problem, for power transformers in known works only thermal and electrical faults are monitored. As a new feature vs. state of art to achieve predictive diagnostic of power transformer fault this work proposes a new electronic instrumentation allowing also for vibration-based mechanical stress diagnosis. Mechanical degradation is tracked through multi-channel vibration measures with sensitivity down to 0.5 mg and signal processing in the transformed frequency domain up to 1 kHz. Experimental measurements on real UPS for railway confirm the validity of the approach.},

The effects of the space vector modulation approaches on the capacitor current are investigated. Based on the analytical results, the method introducing the smaller capacitor current is selected as the optimized modulation approach, which is of paramount importance to avoid the permanent failure of the dc-link capacitors. Then, with the optimized modulation approach, a control-oriented model for the post-fault PWM rectifiers is derived based on the α - β stationary frame, where the capacitor voltage oscillation and deviation are taken into account. The proposed model-based controllers do not require the phase-locked loop (PLL), and the elimination of the PLL means that the post-fault rectifiers can never lose synchronization with the grid. Furthermore, an equation of the required dc voltage for linear modulation is proposed, and using the proposed equation, a correct dc voltage is selected to reject the overmodulation. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed comprehensive design and optimization. Finally, a conclusion can be drawn from the experimental results-that the dc-link capacitor current and the linear modulation should be taken into account when selecting the dc voltage in the post-fault operation.},

It shows that selecting the small filter components (ac choke, dc choke, and dc-link capacitor) results in different performances with respect to those interharmonics issued by motor current imbalance and other noncharacteristic interharmonics. The results are helpful for engineers investigating the effects of drive filters on the input current interharmonic components.},

	abstract = {If a small dc-link capacitor is used in the dc link fed by a single-phase ac source, then the dc-link voltage severely fluctuates at twice of the source frequency. To handle this fluctuation, the concept of “average voltage constraint” is proposed in this study. On the basis of this concept, a flux-weakening scheme, generating the d-axis current reference (idsr*) for the interior permanent-magnet synchronous machine, is devised. The q-axis current reference (iqsr*) is modified for the unity power factor operation in the viewpoint of an ac source without an additional sensor. The proposed scheme has been applied to the inverter-driven 1-kW compressor of an air conditioner. From the experimental results, it has been verified that the compressor operates well at the required operating condition, regardless of the severe fluctuation of dc-link voltage, because of the reduced dc-link capacitance. The frequency spectrum of the ac source current reveals that the harmonics of the source current meet the regulation of IEC 61000-3-2 Class A and that the overall power factor is above 96\% without any additional circuit, such as an input filter and a power factor correction circuit.},

They are based on the most complete motor models, including such features as rotor skin effect. Furthermore, new solutions for selected harmonic elimination (SHE) are given. These new solutions come close to EOC. Also, it has been found that EOC solutions (although basically load-dependent as opposed to SHE) do not vary much with the motor used or the motor model applied. Even using a simple R-L series circuit as motor model does not change the solutions much. It is found that using the solutions gained from such a simple model is not more than two points off the real optimum based on a very complete motor model. (For this definition, the absolute harmonic loss minimum is given as zero points, the overall maximum as 100 points with a linear scale in between.) Therefore, one can use one EOC solution for all motors with sufficient accuracy, or, as second best solution, the new form of SHE. Therefore, the EOC solution can be judged load-independent. The implementation by microprocessor-based systems is as easy for other PWM methods. EOC for three and five switching angles per quarter period is discussed, as well as the new solutions for SHE for up to nine angles.},

The inductor core loss calculation in PWM VSCs is challenging since the current ripple and its duty cycle are varying in each switching cycle. To calculate the core loss, however, generating the loss map as a common method is complicated and time consuming. This paper presents a new modeling method in which the minor B-H loops are categorized according the average dc bias and ac current ripple. The core loss is then modeled via calculating the power loss of averaged minor B-H loop in each category. On the other hand, unlike the loss map method, the presented model needs less iteration to find the core loss. Moreover, in this paper, the effect of dc pre-magnetization is investigated by measuring its influence on the core. As a case study, the core loss of an inductor has been calculated and the experimental results are presented. The inductor is designed with a toroidal Kool Mu powder core for a 5 kW three-phase PWM VSC.},

With the wider applications of VSCs, the harmonics produced by VSCs will provide new challenges of harmonic problems in the modern power system. The harmonics generated by VSCs are caused by the switching characteristics of power electronic devices and the interaction between the ac and dc sides, which is a non-linear and complex problem. Dynamic phasor sequence components (DPSCs) are applied into the analysis of the harmonic produced by VSC in this study. With selecting the DPSCs of current harmonics on ac side and voltage harmonics on dc side as the state variables, a harmonic analysis model of VSC is presented as a linear time invariable system in the state space. The model considers both the detailed switching dynamics and the interactions between the ac and dc sides of VSC. The model also shows the analytical expression of the relationship between harmonics and sequence components of supply voltages. By solving the model, the harmonics generated by VSC under unbalanced conditions can be calculated mathematically. The comparison with simulation and experiment results can testify that the analysis model is very useful to analyse the harmonics of VSCs directly.},

	abstract = {Uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs) have been used in many installations for critical loads that cannot afford power failure or surge during operation. It is often difficult to upgrade the UPS system as the load grows over time. Due to lower cost and maintenance, as well as ease of increasing system capacity, the parallel operation of modularized small-power UPS has attracted much attention in recent years. In this paper, a new scheme for parallel operation of inverters is introduced. A multiple-input-multiple-output state-space model is developed to describe the parallel-connected inverters system, and a model-predictive-control scheme suitable for paralleled inverters control is proposed. In this algorithm, the control objectives of voltage tracking and current sharing are formulated using a weighted cost function. The effectiveness and the hot-swap capability of the proposed parallel-connected inverters system have been verified with experimental results.},

The analysis demonstrates how long cable connections between the power supply system and the load deeply modify the behavior of the single UPS unit. It is shown how the cable inductance interacts with the UPS closed-loop output impedance modifying the control loop gain, ultimately generating resonance phenomena, which deteriorate or even compromise system stability and performances, if suitable provisions are not taken at the design stage. Experimental results carried out on two paralleled three phase, 40 kVA UPS units based on voltage-source inverters topologies confirm the validity of the theoretical discussion and the practical relevance of the phenomenon.},

	abstract = {This study is concerned with the control of three-phase uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems based on a hybrid controller. A UPS must be able to maintain regulated output voltage in the face of all line/load disturbances. In order to achieve this, the control system of a UPS must have a fast transient response and a low steady-state error. Fast controllers cannot always maintain the required steady-state accuracy. Therefore in this study, a hybrid control solution is proposed. In the proposed method, a fast, yet simple, controller based on deadbeat (DB) control law is used to achieve the fast transient response required for UPS output voltage control. Noting that non-linear loads that tend to distort UPS output voltage in steady-state have periodic waveforms in nature, a type of learning controller known as a repetitive controller is added to the DB controller to improve steady-state performance of the UPS system. This results in distortion-free output voltage along with a fast error convergence. The system modelling and controller design for the proposed structure are presented in this study. A brief stability analysis is given. Both simulations and experimental results are shown for verification of the theoretical analysis.},

This paper proposes a method for estimating the synchronous angle through only the measurement of the ac line currents, and is thus called the voltage sensorless control strategy.

Active resonance damping is state of the art to face the problem, but it is still under investigation because of the manifold solutions. It is often realized using many sensors and/or complex control algorithms. In contrast, pure PI control requires only one set of current sensors, and its implementation and design are rather simple and well known from the L filter control. PI control has already been shown to be a suitable solution also for LCL filters, but there are limitations. These are investigated in this paper. System stability is analyzed with respect to different ratios of LCL filter resonance and control frequencies. The latter are important parameters for system design and control. Both line and converter current control are analyzed. For a certain range of frequency ratios, the voltage-oriented PI control gives stable performance without additional feedback, but for ratios outside this range, stable operation is impossible. Experimental tests validate the theoretical results. In addition, an experimentally determined LCL filter transfer function is shown in this paper, which shows a lower resonance peak as expected from commonly used filter models.},

	abstract = {The challenge in controlling a three-phase pulsewidth modulation (PWM) rectifier under balanced conditions arises from the fact that the state-space averaged model reported in literature has a multi-input-multi-output nonlinear structure and furthermore exhibits a nonminimum phase feature. In this paper, a simple single-input-single-output model is constructed by separating the d -axis and the q-axis dynamics through appropriate nonlinear feedforward decoupling while maintaining nearly unity power factor operation. With the proposed model, the nonminimum phase feature inherent in an AC-to-DC rectifier becomes a simple right-half-plane zero appearing in the small-signal control-to-output transfer function. In addition, the model exhibits a close similarity to a DC-DC boost converter under both large-signal and small-signal operating conditions. This makes it possible to extend the system analysis and control design techniques of DC-DC converters to the three-phase PWM rectifier also. The validity of the proposed model has been verified experimentally in the frequency domain under open-loop operation of the PWM rectifier. The usefulness of the model is further demonstrated through closed-loop operation of the rectifier with both voltage mode and inner-current-loop-based schemes.},

It is found that the soft-switched resonant transition time must be much longer than the semiconductor high-level carrier lifetime for effective reduction of switching losses. Constraints on PWM range and PWM resolution as a function of switching frequency are established for a range of soft-switching power converter topologies and the standard hard-switched inverter. For quasi-resonant DC-link topologies, the degradation in PWM resolution causes low-frequency harmonics to be introduced into the output spectrum. Topology-specific features are used to form a comparative assessment of the principal classes of soft-switched power converters. Resonant DC-link topologies are shown to produce the poorest output performance, although they offer the cheapest solution. Auxiliary resonant pole inverters can achieve levels of performance approaching those of the hard-switched topology, while retaining the benefits of soft-switching. It is concluded that the auxiliary commutated pole inverter offers the greatest potential for exploitation despite its relatively high capital cost.

The main advantage of this method is that the switching states of the inverter are directly determined by the controller. Another advantage is that the switching law can be obtained off-line, which significantly reduces the online computation burden. Then the neutral point voltage ripple is minimized by a capacitors voltage balancing controller. Simulation results confirm the feasibility and performance of the proposed control scheme.},

Since the control techniques traditionally employed in industry feature a significant potential for improving the performance and the controller design, the field of power electronics invites the application of advanced hybrid systems methodologies. The computational power available today and the recent theoretical advances in the control of hybrid systems allow one to tackle these problems in a novel way that improves the performance of the system, and is systematic and implementable.

This paper proposes a method to identify the VSC equivalent loss resistance for the proper tuning of the current control loop. It is based on analysis of the closed-loop transient response provided by a synchronous proportional-integral current controller, according to the internal model principle. The method gives a set of loss resistance values linked to working conditions, which can be used to improve the tuning of the current controllers, either by online adaptation of the controller gains or by open-loop adaptive adjustment of them according to prestored data.

These models can be used to evaluate the response of power electronics systems which are composed of commercial converters, since they can be fully parameterized by analyzing the actual converter response. First black-box models of power converters have been recently proposed, but all of them are oriented to DC-DC converters. However, three-phase voltage source inverters are usually applied in current power electronics-based systems, such as aircraft power systems, and a black-box modeling method of this kind of converters has not yet been proposed. In this paper a large-signal black-box modeling method of three-phase voltage source inverters is proposed. The identification of the model is based on the analysis of the converter transient response, which is obtained by means of a set of simple experiments and easily usable fitting algorithms. An experimental validation of the proposed method has been carried out on a 5 kW actual inverter applied on an aircraft power system test bench.},

From the perspective of the current controller dynamics in the low-frequency range, such plant time constant is also suitable for most cases in which an LCL filter is used. As the loop behavior can be significantly influenced by the VSC working conditions, the effects associated to converter losses should be included in the model, through an equivalent series resistance. In addition, the plant inductance may also present important uncertainties with respect to the value of the VSC L/LCL interface filter measured at rated conditions. Thus, in this paper, a method is presented to estimate both parameters of the plant time constant, i.e., the equivalent inductance and resistance in the plant model of current-controlled VSCs. The proposed technique is based on the evaluation of the closed-loop transient responses of both axes of the synchronous reference frame when a proportional-integral current controller is implemented. The method gives a set of resistance and inductance values that should be employed for a rigorous design of the current controllers. Experimental results validate the approach.},

In addition, only an operating point is considered in those designs approaches, but in practical applications, the performance over an operating region has to be ensured due to operative changes in the grid. These situations lead to conservative filter designs with oversized passive elements that require iterations between the design and the simulation/implementation stages to meet the imposed power quality restrictions, with no guarantee of proper performance if the grid parameters are changed. This paper presents the calculation of steady state modulation parameters (CSSMPs) and the exact design (ED) approaches to perform steady state analysis and component design in grid connected VSC-based systems. The proposed formulation is based on the extended harmonic domain (EHD) and explicitly considers the switching process and their constant steady state modulation parameters. Although the proposed approach is applicable for any passive filters configuration, an L-filter active rectifier is used as the test system. The design results are the passive components values and modulating parameters required to meet the design restrictions, explicitly considering the modulation technique used. Time domain simulations validate this design proposal in all the presented cases. The performed analysis gives very useful information about feasible operating region, the number of control solutions, the operating limits of the system under load and voltage source variations, and the effect of the modulation technique.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes the use of the extended harmonic domain as modeling framework in the formulation of optimization problems to compute optimal designs in terms of specific characteristics of the system, such as power losses, cost, size, among others. The overall advantages of use this modeling tool are the explicit consideration of the switching process and its harmonic effects in the formulation. As result, an optimization problem, in which the operating conditions and power quality requirements are explicitly stated as nonlinear restrictions of the problem, is obtained. A case study aimed to minimize the losses of an L-filter based active rectifier is presented, in order to give more detail in the implementation of this proposal. The obtained results show the evolution of the variables involved in the optimal design for several cases as the switching frequency varies. From these results, the optimal switching frequency could be selected along with its optimal design characteristics.},

Therefore, perfect tracking is not assured, and stability may be compromised.

A simple expression to calculate the target leading angle, in delay compensation schemes, is also proposed to improve stability margins by means of a better accuracy than previous approaches.

However, the problem that how time delay affects the stability of digitally controlled grid-connected inverters with LCL filters has not been fully studied. In this paper, a systematic study is carried out on the relationship between the time delay and stability of single-loop controlled grid-connected inverters that employ inverter current feedback (ICF) or grid current feedback (GCF). The ranges of time delay for system stability are analyzed and deduced in the continuous s-domain and discrete z-domain. It is shown that in the optimal range, the existence of time delay weakens the stability of the ICF loop, whereas a proper time delay is required for the GCF loop. The present work explains, for the first time, why different conclusions on the stability of ICF loop and GCF loop have been drawn in previous studies. To improve system stability, a linear predictor-based time delay reduction method is proposed for ICF, while a time delay addition method is used for GCF. A controller design method is then presented that guarantees adequate stability margins. The delay-dependent stability study is verified by simulation and experiment.},

The system dynamics are explored through the continuation of periodic solutions of the associated dynamic equations. The switching process in the DVR converter is taken into account to trace the stability regions through a suitable mathematical representation of the DVR converter. The stability regions in the Thevenin equivalent plane are computed. In addition, the stability regions in the control gains space, as well as the contour lines for different Floquet multipliers, are computed. Besides, the DVR converter model employed in this contribution avoids the necessity of developing very complicated iterative map approaches as in the conventional bifurcation analysis of converters. The continuation method and the DVR model can take into account dynamics and nonlinear loads and any network topology since the analysis is carried out directly from the state space equations. The bifurcation approach is shown to be both computationally efficient and robust, since it eliminates the need for numerically critical and long-lasting transient simulations.

	abstract = {The pulse-width modulated (PWM) voltage-source converter (VSC) and current-source converter (CSC) are the building blocks of most of the switch-mode power electronic systems. Irrespective of the converter type, the controller is supposed to fulfill two objectives: (1) real power flow control which leads to the regulation of the DC quantity (DC voltage in VSC and DC current in CSC), and (2) reactive power flow control on the AC-side. The major difficulty in control is caused by the nonlinearities in the converter model. The existing control techniques are based on the design of the PI-controllers without the knowledge of the converter model, linearizing the nonlinear model, or splitting the original system into linear and nonlinear parts and dealing with them separately. In this paper, a power balance equation and nonlinear input transformation are used to derive a linear model from the original nonlinear model. Then, a decoupled state-feedback control method is applied to the new model. The accuracy of the new model and the performance of the applied control method are evaluated using the simulation results obtained from the PSCAD/EMTDC simulation package. It is shown that as a result of using the new model and applying the state-feedback control technique, the dynamics of the system are considerably improved resulting in short response times. It is also shown that the approach taken in modeling and control results in excellent results even at low switching frequencies making the scheme very suitable for high-power applications},

The use of passive damping does provide a robust solution to address these issues, but at the price of reduced efficiency due to the presence of additional passive components. Hence, a new method is proposed in this paper to optimally design the passive damping circuit for the LCL filters and LCL with multituned LC traps. In short, the optimization problem reduces to the proper choice of the multisplit capacitors or inductors in the high-order filter. Compared to existing design procedures, the proposed method simplifies the iterative design of the overall filter while ensuring the minimum resonance peak with a lower damping capacitor and a lower rated resistor. It is shown that there is only one optimal value of the damping resistor or quality factor to achieve a minimum filter resonance. The passive filters are designed, built, and validated both analytically and experimentally for verification.},

Harmonic mitigation is a welcome “by-product” of the shunt active filter, which comes from damping of harmonic propagation. This paper concludes that the shunt active filter based on detection of voltage at the point of installation is superior in stability to others, and that the best site selection is not the beginning terminal but the end terminal of the primary line in the feeder.

Only when a change is detected is the invasive technique triggered to obtain an accurate measure.},

In this paper different methods are used for continuous grid monitoring in PV inverters. By injecting a noncharacteristic harmonic current and measuring the grid voltage response it is possible to evaluate the grid impedance directly by the PV inverter, providing a fast and low-cost implementation. This principle theoretically provides an accurate result of the grid impedance but when using it in the context of PV integration, different implementation issues strongly affect the quality of the results. This paper also presents a new impedance estimation method including typical implementation problems encountered, and it also presents adopted solutions for online grid impedance measurement.

In order to analyze harmonics and stability, most research is using an analysis method, which is based on the Linear Time Invariant (LTI) approach. However, this can be difficult in terms of complex multi-parallel connected systems, especially in the case of renewable energy, where possibilities for intermittent operation due to the weather conditions exist. Hence, it can bring many different operating points to the power converter, and the impedance characteristics can change compared to the conventional operation. In this paper, a Harmonic State Space modeling method, which is based on the Linear Time varying theory, is used to analyze different operating points of the parallel connected converters. The analyzed results show that the HSS modeling approach explicitly can demonstrate other phenomenon, which can not be found in the conventional LTI approach.

This paper investigates grid connected converter by means of Harmonic State Space (HSS) small signal model, which is modeled from Linear Time varying Periodically (LTP) system. Further, a grid connected converter harmonic matrix is investigated to analyze the harmonic behavior interaction and dynamic transfer procedure.

	abstract = {Understanding about harmonic propagation in wind turbine converter is fundamental to research the influence of these on a large network harmonic distortion. Therefore, the analysis of wind turbine converter harmonic spectrum as well as the influence of converter operating point into the network is urgently important issues in harmonic studies on wind farm. However, the conventional modeling procedure and simplified model for controller design are not enough to analyze such complicated systems. Besides, they have many limitations in terms of including a non-linear component, different operating points and harmonic coupling analysis. Hence, it is critically needed to develop the advanced converter model, which can include almost all the possibilities. This paper develops the advanced Back to Back (BtB) converter model for wind farm application by means of Harmonic State Space (HSS) modeling method. The modeling and analysis results are remarkable that this model can include non-linear component and also show different operating points and harmonic coupling point, where this means each wind power converter can show the different impedance characteristics. The developed model can easily connected into the large wind farm model to analyze the overall steady-state harmonic as well as harmonic stability. All theoretical modeling and analysis is verified by means of simulation and experimental results.},

So far, the DP concept has been restricted to modeling systems with one single electrical source at a fixed fundamental frequency, either one generator or an ideal three-phase AC source. This paper aims to extend the DP modeling methodology to a wider application area. Two major achievements have been introduced: 1) application of DPs for multi-source, multi-frequency systems; 2) modeling of systems with time-varying frequencies. These two techniques enable the use of DPs to study nearly all types of electrical power systems (EPS). The developed theory is validated using a twin-generator system from the More Open Electrical Technologies (MOET) project. The accuracy and effectiveness of the developed models is confirmed by comparing the simulation results of detailed switching models and DP models under both balanced and unbalanced conditions.},

It is useful to determine the system stability and optimize the control parameters. The complete small signal models for the inverter-dominated microgrids have been developed, which are very accurate and could be found in literature. However, the modeling procedure will become very complex when the number of inverters in microgrid is large. One possible solution is to use the reduced-order small signal models for the inverter-dominated microgrids. Unfortunately, the reduced-order small signal models fail to predict the system instabilities. In order to solve the problem, a new modeling approach for inverter-dominated microgrids by using dynamic phasors is presented in this paper. Our findings indicate that the proposed dynamic phasor model is able to predict accurately the stability margins of the system, while the conventional reduced-order small signal model fails. In addition, the virtual ω-E frame power control method, which deals with the power coupling caused by the line impedance X/R characteristic, has also been chosen as an application example of the proposed modeling technique.},

	abstract = {As the More-Electric Aircraft (MEA) has been identified as a major trend of future aircraft, the on-board Electrical Power System (EPS) will see significant increased numbers of Power Electronic Converters (PECs) and motor drive systems. In order to study the behaviour and performance of the EPS in MEA, extensive simulation studies need to be done during the system design process. This in return, gives the need to have computationally efficient and accurate models to reduce the design period. In this thesis, the Dynamic Phasor (DP) is used for modelling EPS in the MEA. The DP technique is a general averaging method and naturally a frequency-domain analysis tool. Compared with other averaging models, which is only efficient under balanced conditions, the DP model maintains efficiency under both balanced and unbalanced conditions. The DP technique has been widely used in modelling the constant, single frequency EPS. In this thesis, the DP technique is extended to modelling time-varying frequency EPS. The application of DP in modelling a multi-generator, multi-frequency system is for the first time, developed in this thesis. The developed theory allows a wider application of the DPs. The developed DP model covers key elements in MEA electrical power systems, including the synchronous generator, control, transmission lines, uncontrolled rectifiers, PWM converters and 18-pulse autotransformer rectifier units. The DP model library developed based on this thesis allows the flexibility to study various EPS’s by integrating elements from the library. A twin-generator aircraft EPS, which is based on the More Open Electrical Technology (MOET) large aircraft EPS architecture, is used to demonstrate the application of DP models. Comparing the DP model with the ABC model (models in three-phase coordinates) and the DQ0 model (models in a synchronous dq frame), the efficiency and the accuracy of the DP model are demonstrated under both balanced and unbalanced conditions.},

	abstract = {For the efficiency and simplicity of electric systems, the dc based power electronics systems are widely used in variety applications such as electric vehicles, ships, aircrafts and also in homes. In these systems, there could be a number of dynamic interactions between loads and other dc-dc converters. Hence, in order to analyze these problems, simulations are required to consider such a complex system, which typically are time consuming. However, simulations in the time domain may increase the calculation time and computer memory. Even though several simplified approaches may be developed based on the state-space averaging and generalized averaging, these also have limitations to show the same results as with the non-linear time domain simulations. This paper presents a modeling and simulation method for a large dc power electronic system by using Harmonic State Space (HSS) modeling. Through this method, the required computation time and CPU memory for large dc power electronics systems can be reduced. Besides, the achieved results show the same results as with the non-linear time domain simulation, but with the faster simulation time which is beneficial in a large network.},

Using stationary frame PR controller to replace PI controller in dq synchronous frame directly leads to analytical errors, especially in low frequency stage. Another straightforward analysis method is to use stationary frame PI controller to replace PI controller in dq synchronous frame, however the coupling terms in dq synchronous frame are ignored and the approximation is not accurate. The accurate stationary frame equivalent model of PI controller is established. For system controlled in dq synchronous frame, the established model can be used to precisely predict system performance and thus guides control parameters design process.

A microgrid system with two inverters working as DERs is proposed. The controllers for the inverters are designed in the dq reference frame. Nonlinear equations are derived to reflect the system dynamics. These equations are linearized around steady-state operating points to develop a state-space model of the microgrid. An averaged model is used in the derivation of the mathematical model that results in a simplified system of equations. An eigenvalue analysis is completed using the linearized model to determine the small-signal stability of the system. A simulation of the proposed microgrid system consisting of two inverter based DERs, passive loads, and a distribution line is performed. An experimental testbed is designed to investigate the system's dynamics during load perturbation.

To model the input impedance of line-frequency rectifiers, a direct linearization technique was developed recently and has been applied to model direct multipulse rectifiers without using inter-phase transformers. This paper extends the previous work and uses double-Fourier series method to develop describing (mapping) functions for the rectifier bridge. The double-Fourier method overcomes the limitations of conventional Fourier analysis which requires the perturbation frequency to be commensurable with the line fundamental frequency. The method is also applied to model the input impedance of multipulse rectifiers with interphase transformers.

The modeling method assumes known impedance of the circuit on the dc side of the rectifier bridge (including its output filter and the load), and determines the corresponding ac input impedance by using a current and voltage mapping function which describes the operation of the rectifier bridge in the frequency domain. In this approach, closed-form analytical expressions are derived for the ac input impedance as functions of the dc circuit impedance. The resulting models are intended for stability analysis and design of large ac power systems involving significant number of rectification loads, such as more-electric aircraft power systems and microgrids.

Especially studies about the stability and the harmonics interaction are critical in order to establish the required performance in a power network.

This paper compares the small-signal modeling methods for harmonic analysis of AC - DC converters and discusses their advantages and limitations. The Harmonic State Space (HSS) model based on the Linear Time-Periodically varying (LTP) system and the traditional small signal model based on the Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system are evaluated.

To investigate microgrid dynamic stability, a small-signal model of a typical microgrid containing asynchronous generator based wind turbine, synchronous diesel generator, power electronic based energy storage and power network is proposed in this paper. The small-signal model of each of the subsystem is established respectively and then the global model is set up in a global reference axil frame. Eigenvalues distributions of the microgrid system under certain steady operating status are identified to indicate the damping of the oscillatory terms and its effect on system stability margin. Eigenvalues loci analysis is also presented which helps identifying the relationship among the dynamic stability, system configuration and operation status, such as the variation of intermittent generations and ESS with different control strategies. The results obtained from the model and eigenvalues analysis are verified through simulations and experiments on a study microgrid system.},

One of the challenges related to the grounding configuration for DGUs is the harmonics generated by power electronic converters employed in DGUs. These harmonics can raise the ground potentials and disrupt the function of ground fault protection. This paper develops and tests a frequency-selective grounding configuration for grid-connected DGUs. The developed grounding configuration offers limiting ground potentials and ground fault currents, while imposing negligible impacts on the function of ground fault protective devices. The frequency-selective grounding configuration is designed and tested for two wind energy conversion systems and a photovoltaic system.

Among these ancillary functions, harmonics compensation is becoming more interesting and important with the growth of nonlinear loads in today's power distribution system. When controlled properly, the DG-grid interfacing converters can provide effective harmonic compensation for the distribution power system. However, the conventional harmonic control methods used for active power filters (APFs) may not be suitable for DG units, where the flow of real and reactive power limits the switching frequency to be lower than APFs, especially when the capacity of DG is large. At this low switching frequency, harmonic compensation performance or even the system stability may be affected. In this paper, a harmonic compensation approach suitable for DG-grid interfacing converters at low switching frequency is proposed.},

In general, current-controlled methods have been widely adopted in grid-connected converters nowadays. Nevertheless, in an islanded system, the voltage control of DG units is desired to provide direct voltage support to the loads. Due to the absence of closed-loop line current controller, the voltage control scheme can hardly regulate the DG unit's line current harmonics. Furthermore, if not addressed properly, the transfer between the grid-connected operation and autonomous islanding operation will introduce nontrivial transient currents. To overcome the drawbacks of voltage- and current-controlled DG units, this paper develops a hybrid voltage and current control method (HCM). The proposed method allows the coordinated closed-loop control of the DG unit fundamental voltage and line harmonic currents. With the HCM, local harmonic loads of the DG unit can even be compensated without using harmonic current extraction. In addition, the HCM guarantees smooth transition during the grid-connected/islanding operation mode transfer.

Moreover, a closed-loop power control scheme is employed to directly derive the fundamental current reference without using any phase-locked loops (PLL).

	abstract = {Systems with hysteresis present challenges to control designers due to the difficulty in analyzing the effect of hysteresis on the system's behavior. In this paper we propose a novel approach to the analysis of the harmonic content produced by a hysteresis operator when it is subject to a periodic input. The commonly used Prandtl-Ishlinskii (PI) operator is used as an example. In particular, we present an algorithm for evaluating the Fourier series of the outputs of individual elementary hysteresis units (called hysterons) comprising the operator. Each output is reconstructed as a combination of the input and a series of pulses. The formation of these pulse waves requires computation of time instants when the hysteron behavior switches, and these times are evaluated using knowledge of the input signal and hysteresis parameters. Illustrative examples are presented for a play operator (hysteron for the PI operator), when it is subject to a sinusoidal signal and a sawtooth signal, respectively, and we show that the resulting Fourier coefficients are functions of the signal amplitude and the play radius. We also show that these calculations can be used as a control design tool for systems with hysteresis, for example, by providing guidance on selecting the order of the servocompensator for controlling such systems.},

Due to these advantages of AHCC, the switching frequency and switching losses will be diminished appropriately. Some simulations are done in Matlab/Simulink.

The switching control algorithms of the HCC based SVM manage to generate compensated current according to the reference current. Harmonics extraction is based on the instantaneous active and reactive power theorem in time domain by calculating the power compensation. A closed loop control system is carried out and the error current is the difference between the reference current which is obtained from the power compensation and the actual current needs to be injected back into the power grid. By implementing this control strategy, the APF manages to generate better compensated harmonics currents to the power grid.

The controller takes the average voltages of the phase-leg switched outputs as an approximation to the load back-EMFs, and uses this result to vary the hysteresis bands to maintain constant phase leg switching frequencies. The switching frequency control process is then further refined by fine tuning the hysteresis band variations to synchronise the zero crossings of the phase leg current errors with a fixed reference clock, to ensure nearest space vector switching and hence achieve the best possible harmonic switching performance. Finally, a technique is proposed to replace the third phase leg current regulator with a fixed frequency open loop PWM modulator, where its commanded reference is generated from the average switched output voltage of the other two phases. This avoids the hazard of three independent current regulators in a conventional system adversely interacting as an over constrained control problem, and allows the linear modulation range to be increased by adding a common mode third harmonic component to the third phase leg reference command.},

	volume = {2},
	doi = {10.1109/APAP.2011.6180755},
	abstract = {As a type of renewable energy, photovoltaic system has attracted increasingly great attention recently for its simple topology, control strategy and high efficiency. Grid-connected current control strategy, a key point of photovoltaic system, also becomes a hot research. At present, the current control strategies of photovoltaic inverter are divided into indirect and direct current control. Due to its simple theory and no current feedback, indirect current control strategy is commonly used in the situation that has few requirements on dynamic response. Direct current control, mainly including hysteresis and the space vector (SVPWM) control strategy, has been widely used because of its fast dynamic response and higher grid-connected current quality. Hysteresis control has many advantages, such as simplicity, easy implementation, fast dynamic response and insensitive to load, etc., but its application is limited for unfixed switching frequency and high switching loss. Comparing to hysteresis control, space vector control has low switching frequency and loss. However, its improvement is also restricted by lower dynamic response and higher sensitivity to system parameter. Therefore, A new control method: hysteresis space vector control, which has good dynamic performance and lower switching frequency and loss, have been proposed by some scholars, through combining the advantages of hysteresis with space vector control. But the new problem is that the total harmonic distortion (THD) is large in this method. With the photovoltaic power generation technology widely used, the higher requirements of grid-connected current quality have been proposed in the relevant China and international standards. In order to reduce THD, a new segmentation control strategy is firstly proposed in this paper. In this new strategy, the threshold of the current error vector was pre-set. When the actual current error is greater than the threshold, the pure hysteresis control strategy will be ad- pted to achieve the current fast track; when the current error is less than it, the hysteresis SVPWM will be adopted to reduce the switching frequency and loss. Then, the model of this improved control strategy has been established in this paper. Contrasting these control strategies by matlab/simulink simulation software, the results show that the new segmentation control strategy not only ensures fast dynamic response, lower switching frequency and system loss, but also significantly reduces current total harmonic distortion, and improves the quality of grid-connected current. Finally, a 1kW photovoltaic system has been built in this paper, and the feasibility and the superiority of the new segmentation control strategy have been further verified.},

Experimental confirmation of the analytical results for the control DF are presented.},

The other feature is an estimation technique of the power-source voltages, which can be performed by calculating the active and reactive power for each switching state of the converter from the line currents. A digital-signal-processor-based experimental system was developed, and experimental tests were conducted to examine the controllability. As a result, it was confirmed that the total power factor and efficiency were more than 97\% and 93\% over the load power range from 200 to 1400 W, respectively.

Bounds on the error of a solution of given order are obtained using a contraction mapping theorem, and the paper also studies the problem of when such a finite order approximation method is capable of predicting a specific periodic solution of a particular system of O.D.E.'s. A number of examples show how the method is applied to autonomous systems, both critical and non-critical, and demonstrate that discontinuities and memory in the nonlinear terms do not preclude either the finding of solutions or the testing of their validity.},

The functions describing the surfaces need not be specified in specific expressions, so that both the form and parameters of the functions can be fine-tuned to match experimental results. They are identified by fitting the surfaces with the generalized orthogonal polynomials in terms of displacement and hysteretic restoring force. The proposed method is applied to the modeling of hysteretic behavior of a wire-cable vibration isolator from experimental data. Excellent agreement between the predicted and experimental hysteresis loops is obtained.

The controller takes into account the discrete states of the voltage source inverter (VSI), and the current errors are predicted for each sampling period. Voltage vectors are selected by a graph algorithm, whereby the most appropriate vector is chosen based on an optimization criterion. However, this depends on whether the state of the system is transient or steady. In the first case, the current error should be minimized as fast as possible in order to obtain fast dynamics. In the latter one, the VSI switching behavior is optimized since the switching losses account for a large amount of the total converter losses in high-power drive systems. MPDCC has been developed for a general neutral-point isolated resistive-inductive load with an internal voltage source. For demonstration, the presented control strategy has been implemented on a small-scale permanent-magnet synchronous machine drive system with a two-level VSI. This new approach has several advantages. The most important one is that the switching frequency is reduced up to 70\% compared to linear control combined with pulsewidth modulation. Second, MPDCC obtains fast dynamic responses, which are already known from, e.g., direct torque control.},

The one producing the smaller current error at the end of the sampling interval is chosen, thus obtaining drastic reduction of the switching frequency. In the second method, the best fitting active voltage vector succeeds the zero vector during the same time interval. A simple algorithm is used to calculate the duty cycle thus gaining the smallest possible current error. The method is compared with the CRPWM.

To overcome the shortage of the conventional vector control technique, this paper proposes a new direct-current d–q vector control mechanism in a nested-loop control structure, based on which an optimal control strategy is developed in a nonlinear programming formulation. The behaviors of both the conventional and proposed control methods are compared and evaluated in simulation and laboratory hardware experiment environments, both of which demonstrates that the proposed approach is effective for grid-connected power converter control in a wide system conditions while the conventional standard vector control approach may behave improperly especially when the converter operates beyond its PWM saturation limit.},

The shooting method, which is largely used to compute the solution in the time domain when the VM is forced by a small-signal perturbation, is studied. The proposed analytical approach can be exploited to improve accuracy in the simulation of the effects of noise sources. In particular, we justify from an analytical standpoint the adoption of a suitable periodicity constraint in the shooting method. We exploit the properties of block circulant matrices that naturally arise in the description of the problem. We prove that the frequency of the small-signal perturbation must be different from that of the unperturbed oscillator to avoid inaccuracy of the shooting method due to the existence of singularities in the VM formulation, and derive a method that allows us to get closer to the singularity.},

	abstract = {Voltage source converters (VSCs) are widely used today. At the generation level, VSCs serve as interfaces for distributed energy sources. At the transmission level, VSCs are employed to improve system stability and control power flow. At the distribution level, VSCs are used to improve power quality. Therefore, accurate models of the VSC are essential for system planning. The focus of this dissertation is on steady state models of the VSC for harmonic study. In order to interface a VSC model with existing harmonic power flow programs, the VSC is modeled either as a voltage-dependent harmonic current source or a Norton equivalent harmonic current source. However, due to the nonlinear and time-varying nature of the VSC, iterative techniques need to be employed in the models in order to fully characterize the steady state behavior of the converter. This dissertation presents two types of iteration techniques. The first one is based on the time domain shooting method and Broyden's iterative algorithm to greatly improve the iteration time required for the VSC. The second method is based on a hybrid method in which the VSC is modeled in the time domain while the controller is modeled in the frequency domain. The hybrid method offers an advantage of not enlarging the number of unknown variables as the switching frequency increases.
Unlike the existing current injection models, both proposed VSC models can account for (i) the interaction between the power system and the VSC, (ii) the interaction between the ac side and dc side of the converter, (iii) the controllers' impact on the harmonics, (iv) the harmonic interaction between multiple VSCs.},

Furthermore, for simplicity in discretization, the integral formulation of the dynamical equations is considered. Thereby, the problem is converted into a mathematical programming problem which can be solved by the well-developed parameter optimization algorithms. The main advantages of the present method are that: (i) it obtains good results even by using a small number of collocation points and the rate of convergence is high; (ii) the switching times can be captured accurately; and (iii) the wrongly chosen number of switching points can be detected by the results of the method.

	abstract = {This dissertation discusses the way to increase the speed of voltage regulation (VR) without degrading other functions, such as the system efficiency, and the required control functions (AVP, current sharing and interleaving).
The easiest way to increase the speed of the VR is to increase the switching frequency. However, higher switching frequency results in system efficiency degradation. This paper uses two approaches to deal with this issue. The first one is the architecture approach. The other is the fast transient control approach.
For the architecture approach, a two-stage architecture is chosen. With the two-stage architecture, a high performance VR can be easily implemented. However, the light-load efficiency of two-stage architecture is not good because the bus voltage is designed for the full-load efficiency which is not optimized for the light load. The light-load efficiency is also important factor and it should be maximized because it is related to the battery life of mobile application or the energy utilization. Therefore, Adaptive Bus Voltage Positioning (ABVP) control has been proposed. By adaptively adjusting the bus voltage according to the load current, the system efficiency can be optimized for whole load range.
In this dissertation, in order to raise the first stage bandwidth, a stability analysis is performed. The instability loop (TABVP ) is identified, and a small signal model to predict this loop is suggested. TABVP is related to the first stage bandwidth. With the higher first stage bandwidth, the peak magnitude of TABVP is larger. When the peak magnitude of T ABVP touches 0dB, the system becomes unstable. Two solutions are proposed to reduce this TABVP magnitude without decreasing the first stage bandwidth. One method is to increase the feedforward gain and the other approach is to use a low pass filter. With these strategies, the ABVP system can be designed to be stable while pushing first stage bandwidth as high as possible. The ABVP-AVP system and its design are verified with hardware.
A multiphase hysteretic control method is proposed which can achieve interleaving without losing its benefits. Using the phase locked loop (PLL), this control method locks the phase and frequency of the duty cycles to the reference clocks by modifying the size of the hysteretic band, to say, hysteretic band width. By phase shifting the reference clocks, interleaving can be achieved under steady state. During the load transient, the system loses the phase-locking function due to the slow hysteretic band width changing loop, and the system then reacts quickly to the load change without the interruption from the phase locking function (or the interleaving function).
The proposed hysteretic control method consists of two loops, the fast hysteretic control loop and the slow hysteretic band width changing loop. These two nonlinear loops are difficult to model and analyze together. Therefore, assuming these two loops can be separated because of the speed difference, the phase plane model is used for the fast hysteretic control loop and the sampled data model is then used for the slow hysteretic band width changing loop. With these models, the proposed hysteretic control method can be analyzed and properly designed. However, if the transient occurs before the slow hysteretic band width changing loop settles down, the transient may start with the large hysteretic band width and the output voltage peak can exceed the specification. To prevent this, a hysteretic band width limiter is inserted.
With the hardware, the proposed hysteretic control method and its design are verified. A two-phase VR with 300kHz switching frequency is built and the output capacitance required is only 860μF comparing to 1600μF output capacitance with the 50kHz bandwidth linear control method.
The proposed hysteretic control method saturates the controller during the transient and the transient peak voltage is determined by the power stage parameters, the inductance and the output capacitors. By decreasing the inductance, the output capacitors are reduced. However, small inductance results in the low efficiency. In order to resolve this, the coupled inductor is used. With the coupled inductor, the transient inductance can be reduced with the same steady state inductance. Therefore, the transient speed can be faster without lowering down the system efficiency. The proposed hysteretic control method with the coupled inductor can be implemented using the DCR current sensing network.
A two-phase VR with the proposed hysteretic control and the coupled inductor is built and the output capacitance is only 660μF comparing to 860μF output capacitance with the proposed hysteretic control only. A 23\% capacitor reduction is achieved. And compared to the 50kHz bandwidth linear control method, a 60\% capacitor reduction is achieved. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)},

The synthetic ripple modulator (SRM) allows proper hysteretic operation even with a small and corrupted output voltage ripple. This paper discusses the dynamic behavior of the SRM. Small-signal characteristics of the modulator are derived. An easy-to-use numerically efficient model has been developed to accurately predict the small- and large-signal behavior of the converter driven by the SRM. The model is able to predict the small-signal behavior of the SRM up to half the switching frequency with sufficient accuracy. It can predict the same large-signal responses as real-time simulation, but at two orders of magnitude less in computation time.

	abstract = {Battery-supplied systems demand fast, power efficient, and compact power supplies. Although linear regulators are quick and small, tiny batteries cannot sustain their losses for long. Pulse-width-modulated (PWM) switchers are considerably more efficient, but also slower. Luckily, hysteretic converters can respond within one switching cycle. Stabilizing the system for maximum speed with a hysteretic inductor-current loop, however, which is not linear, is not straightforward. This paper shows how load dumps delay the response of the hysteretic oscillator that the current loop implements. Knowing the worse-case dump and the delay it causes reveals the lowest output capacitance that maintains stable operation at maximum speed. The converter designed here can therefore recover, as predicted, from 100-mA load dumps in 2 μs with 10 μF and 45° of phase margin.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the design procedure and performance of an LCL grid filter for a medium-voltage neutral-point clamped converter to be adopted for a multimegawatt (multi-MW) wind turbine. The unique filter design challenges in this application are driven by a combination of the medium-voltage converter, a limited allowable switching frequency, component physical size and weight concerns, and the stringent limits for allowable injected current harmonics. Traditional design procedures of grid filters for lower power and higher switching frequency converters are not valid for a multi-MW filter connecting a medium-voltage converter switching at low frequency to the electric grid. This paper demonstrates a frequency-domain-model-based approach to determine the optimum filter parameters that provide the necessary performance under all operating conditions given the necessary design constraints. To achieve this goal, new concepts, such as virtual-harmonic content and virtual filter losses are introduced. Moreover, a new passive-damping technique that provides the necessary damping with low losses and very little degradation of the high-frequency attenuation is proposed.},

	abstract = {The presence of distributed resources (DR) and the subject of distributed generation (DG) are rapidly growing in modern distribution networks. Many of these resources use renewable energies, and many of them provide electrical energy in the form of dc voltage source. Consequently, the connection of such resources to the utility grid needs a dc/ac conversion stage. Voltage source converters (VSC) are widely used for this application as they have a mature technology. These converters are usually connected to the utility grid through a simple L filter to reduce the current harmonics injected to the grid. However, higher order filters, like LCL filters, can provide better harmonic attenuation and reduce the filter size at the same time. This paper is concerned with the subject of grid connected converters via LCL filter topology. The advantages of using LCL filter as compared to simple L filter are discussed. Mathematical expressions and plots are given to show the performance of these filters. The design criteria are stated. Different design issues like the total size of magnetic components, ripple current and filter resonant frequency are addressed. Design guidelines are given for optimal selection of filter components},

Two three-phase four-leg inverters, together with dc microsources and nonlinear loads, are employed to construct a general series-parallel grid-interfacing system. Through the introduction of multilevel control objectives, it is illustrated that the proposed system could ride through voltage disturbances and continue the power transfer between the local generation and the grid, while a high-quality voltage is maintained for the local loads.

However, these models are found to require very small simulation steps and the achieved time-domain accuracy is not satisfactory for medium frequency converters. The core issue of accuracy loss is identified and corresponding improvement is proposed. User written state-space models in the abc frame and the dq frame are analyzed in depth. Different solvers, including the Dommel's method, the Heun's method, and the Runge-Kutta method were adopted and compared in solving the state-space models. A high-power 2-kHz LCL dc-dc converter is taken as the test system. It is found that the AVM in the dq rotating frame based on the Runge-Kutta solver is able to generate very accurate time-domain responses compared to the detailed switching model with almost 100 times improvement in simulation speed.

Building on a recently proposed LCL-VSC converter, which suffers from low efficiency at partial load, an operating strategy of switchable capacitor banks instead of a fixed central capacitor is proposed to improve the efficiency. A theoretical framework is presented to enable LCL-VSC to achieve fault current limiting and avoid the blocking of insulated-gate bipolar transistors during dc faults. A design of traditional L-VSC (either two level or multilevel) that can limit fault current is also mathematically deduced as a comparison. The L-VSC can be designed to limit the fault current close to rated value, but this comes at an increase of around 40\% in semiconductor costs and operating losses. The results show that the efficiency of LCL-VSC is similar to the conventional L-VSC. LCL-VSC cannot isolate dc faults, but their reduced fault current enables the converter to ride through dc faults and this significantly reduces the requirements on operating speed and capacity of dc circuit breakers. The LCL-VSC is especially suitable to replace conventional L-VSC at the grid points where a strong ac grid will feed significant dc fault current to the dc grid. Detailed PSCAD simulations confirm theoretical findings.},

The authors describe how it is possible to use Pspice to simulate real control scheme that will be implemented in the converter and test its real large and small-signal behaviour. The process is quite simple, the averaged state equations method (without any small-signal approximation) leaves a circuit representation of all the averaged state equations in one sole circuit. Then is possible to use Pspice to simulate the real large and small-signal behaviour of the converter with real control schemes that will be implemented on it. This is demonstrated by comparing the simulations result of a low ripple buck power converter with conductance control using Pspice, with the real behaviour of a prototype power converter set-up},

Conventional rational fitting methods intrinsically get into ill condition because the sn terms in the rational function take a wide range of values which cannot be accurately treated within machine arithmetic accuracy. The proposed algorithm averts the ill conditioning by partitioning the given frequency response into sections along the frequency axis. Rational fitting is applied to each section of the frequency response to identify the poles, and then the corresponding residue matrices are obtained by a standard least-squares procedure using the entire frequency response. Adaptive weighting, column scaling, and iteration step adjustment are utilized to facilitate the rational fitting. The proposed identification algorithm is applied to obtain a reduced-order equivalent of a 500-kV power network, and the equivalent is used in a switching transient simulation to demonstrate its performance.},

	abstract = {Harmonics in power systems is now a subject of wide ramifications. One particular aspect is that of capturing harmonic data at selected locations in a power network and processing it identify to harmonics and to quantify their magnitudes and arguments. Circumstances are encountered in practice for which the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) cannot be relied on to achieve valid harmonic component identification. These are where there are subharmonics, harmonics which are not integer multiples of the supply frequency, and where two or more harmonics have only small frequency separations between them. The paper reports a new procedure which fulfils the requirements of practical harmonic analysis. It avoids altogether the limitations of the DFT algorithm and is based on the nomination of a distorted waveform model expressed in terms of a sum of sinusoidal functions. Model parameters are the frequencies, magnitudes and arguments of the harmonics in the waveform it represents. The error between this model waveform and the actual one represented in captured form is minimised. At the minimum, the parameters of the model are those of the waveform for which harmonic analysis is required. A key advance in this parametric form of analysis is that of a partitioning of the data for the waveform to be analysed into a training set and a test set. This partitioned form generalised parametric harmonic analysis is thus developed. Key concepts are clarified via a numerical example to illustrate how this approach can excel for the harmonic analysis in power systems},

The availability of an instrument able to quantify the deterioration of the power quality due to the harmonic distortion, to assess whether or not this deterioration is caused by a polluting load connected after the metering section and to quantify the effects of such a load on the power quality therefore represents an important point for the correct operation of the electric power system.

Some parameters are also defined in order to quantify the electric power quality and the deteriorating effects of a polluting load.

	abstract = {Voltage-source converters are commonly employed as rectifiers for providing a regulated dc voltage from an ac power source. In a typical microdistribution system, the power grid is nonideal and often presents itself as a voltage source with significant impedance. Thus, power converters connected to the grid interact with each other via the nonideal grid. In this paper, we study how stability can be compromised in a system of interacting grid-connected converters, which are used typically as rectifiers. Specifically, the stable operating regions in the selected parameter space may shrink when grid-connected converters interact under certain conditions. We consider the effect of both source (grid) impedance and transmission line impedance between converters, and derive bifurcation boundaries in the parameter space. A small-signal model in the dq-frame is adopted to analyze the interacting system using an impedance-based approach. It is shown that the system of interacting converters can become unstable. Moreover, results are presented in design-oriented forms so as to facilitate the identification of variation trends of stable operation boundaries.

Then it was applied to extract another two parameters in dynamic J-A model with five parameters in static J-A model as inputs. It is found that extracting five parameters in static J-A model is relatively easy but extracting another two parameters in dynamic J-A model needs extra effort, especially specifying their ranges. After obtaining all seven parameters, we applied dynamic J-A model to predict the current behavior of a practical switching circuit and successfully obtained the inrush current phenomenon as experimentally observed and reported in literature. We conclude that application of DE method to extract seven parameters in dynamic J-A model for ferrite is feasible.},

The iron loss map, previously reported by the authors, is created by measuring the dynamic minor loop on the B-H plane, and this is used for the calculation of inductor iron loss in the dc chopper circuit. However, in the case of an AC filter inductor used in a PWM inverter, the iron loss map cannot be directory applied to the iron loss calculation. In this paper, an iron loss calculation for an ac filter inductor is presented by expanding the loss map method. We describe the principle of expansion and the practical procedure for the calculation, which utilizes the loss map and a conventional circuit simulator. Iron loss for the ac filter inductor under some typical modulation methods of the PWM inverter are calculated and discussed with regard to the relation between the modulation methods and iron loss. The calculated results are verified using experimental results from a 500-W inverter setup. The inductor loss and conversion efficiency of the PWM inverter are measured for each modulation method.},

High current total harmonic distortion (THD) occurs when PV inverters operate under light load conditions due to low solar insolation. A general model modified from the conventional control structure diagram is introduced to analyze the harmonic formation process. Causes of the current harmonics are summarized and its relationship with output power levels is analyzed. The field measurement for current harmonics is carried out at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) microgrid to validate the analysis results. In particular for two-stage inverter, unlike previous papers that assume the DC-link voltage is constant, the DC-link voltage ripple is identified as the source of a series of odd harmonics. A mew periodic time-varying model is proposed by including the DC-link voltage ripple into the conventional current control loop model. This model is able to simulate the characteristics of the harmonic components and show their dependence on the DC-link voltage ripple.},

	abstract = {The increased use of power electronic controlled equipment, such as variable speed drives, automated production lines, personal computers and non-linear electronic devices in power systems has given rise to a type of voltage and current waveform distortion called as ‘harmonics’. Harmonic can be defined as the undesirable components of a distorted periodic waveform whose frequencies are the integer multiples (non-integer multiples in case of inter-harmonics, and the frequency less than fundamental frequency in case of sub-harmonics) of the fundamental frequency. Presence of these harmonics results in increased losses, equipment heating and loss-of-life, and interference with protection, control and communication circuits as well as customer loads. The research has been underway since very beginning for control of power system harmonics and to supply consumers with reliable and ‘clean’ fundamental-frequency sinusoidal electric power that does not represent a damaging threat to their equipment. This paper, therefore, reviews the progress made in power system harmonics research and development since its inception. Attempts are also made to highlight the current and future issues involved in the development of quality and reliable electric power technology for future applications.

This work derives the basic rules for adjusting the discontinuous PWM appropriately with special focus on the semiconductor switching losses.

	abstract = {This paper presents the estimation of harmonics in a voltage source converter based HVDC (VSC-HVDC) system for designing AC side filters. The extended Kalman filter (EKF) is well known for estimating amplitude, phase, frequency, and harmonic content of a signal corrupted with noise. However, the EKF algorithm suffers from instability due to linearization and costly calculation of Jacobian matrices, and its performance deteriorates when the signal model is highly nonlinear. This paper, therefore, proposes an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) to overcome these difficulties of linearization and derivative calculations for robust tracking of harmonics in VSC-HVDC system. The model and measurement error covariance matrices Q and R along with the UKF parameters are selected using a modified particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. To circumvent the problem of premature convergence and local minima, a dynamically varying inertia weight based on the variance of the population fitness is used. This results in a better local and global searching ability of the particles, which improves the convergence of the velocity and better accuracy of the UKF parameters. Various simulation results for harmonic signals corrupted with noise obtained from VSC-HVDC system reveal significant improvement in noise rejection and speed of convergence and accuracy.},

The book begins by providing the basic fundamentals of magnetics, followed by an explanation of design using the Kg or Ap techniques. It also covers subjects such as laminations, tape cores, powder cores and ferrites, and iron alloys.  In addition, new topics include:   Autotransformer design Common-mode inductor design Series saturable reactor design Self-saturating magnetic amplifier Designing inductors for a given resistance  With the goal of making inductors that are lighter and smaller but still meet requirements, this book helps users avoid many antiquated rules of thumb, to achieve a better, more economical design. Presenting transformer design examples with step-by-step directions and numerous tables and graphics for comparison, it remains a trusted guide for the engineers, technicians, and other professionals who design and evaluate transformers and inductors.

A thorough understanding of digital signal processing fundamentals and techniques is essential for anyone whose work is concerned with signal processing applications. Digital Signal Processing begins with a discussion of the analysis and representation of discrete-time signal systems, including discrete-time convolution, difference equations, the z-transform, and the discrete-time Fourier transform. Emphasis is placed on the similarities and distinctions between discrete-time. The course proceeds to cover digital network and nonrecursive (finite impulse response) digital filters. Digital Signal Processing concludes with digital filter design and a discussion of the fast Fourier transform algorithm for computation of the discrete Fourier transform.},
