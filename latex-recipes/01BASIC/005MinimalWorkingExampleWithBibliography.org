# Minimal example with bibliography in default biblatex style.

This is a minimal example for a bibliography, using the default style of biblatex, and the =\printbibliography= command.

I doubt that there is any useful information here\cite{wikibook}.

All we know is limited, apart from knowing the answer we all know. Or do we? Wombat and Koala have discovered some interesting things\cite{wombat2016}.

If you want to add a space between the text and the citation, use
=\nobreakspace=.  For example: Some people are too nosy. What can happen to them is described by Laura Lion\nobreakspace\cite[9]{lion2010}.
