  ;;; Commentary:
  ;;; this is only some of the packags.
  ;;; Some other required packages are loaded in the following postload files.
  ;;; using prelude-require-package ensures that the packges are loaded
  ;;; at the time required, if necessary.

  ;;; Code:

  (require 'prelude-packages)

  ;; also load prelude-required packages manually.
  ;; this loads packages which are not (auto-) loaded otherwise.
  ;; apparently prelude-required packages will be available after restarting emacs twice ...
