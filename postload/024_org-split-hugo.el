;;; Commentary:
;;; Utilities for blog + website editing with HUGO

;;; org-hugo-autosplit: split an entire org-file into subfiles for export to hugo.
;;; The contents of any section that has a property "filename" will be
;;; exported under the same directory as the source file.
;;; the filename property gives the filename.
;;; the heading becomes title property in yaml front-matter.
;;; the weight is set according to the order of the exported sections.
;;;
;;; Sections with property "foldername" set a subfolder for saving
;;; subsequent file sections.
;;; Folder path is constructed by concatenating a cumulative list of subfolders.
;;; The foldername property sets the component of the folder path
;;; in the corresponding depth of subsections in a list of path components.
;;; Construct _index.md from the name of the folder section.
;;; Increment a folder_index variable to set weight for folder _index.md.

;;; Code:

;;; provides commands for hugo config, page creation, publish and
(prelude-load-require-packages '(easy-hugo dash)) ;; dash list utility functions

;;; org-check-agenda-file stops the file creation process
;;; and therefore must be redefined here.
;;; Consequences of overwriting it are not yet checked, but seem irrelevant.

First compute the path based on levels and previous input.
Then export the file using the path.
Files are automatically stored in nested folders corresponding
to the level of the section that is the source of the file.
The path for the nested folders is stored in variable FOLDER-COMPONENTS.
Level 1 corresponds to root level of the base folder path.
Therefore for level 1 the string to add to the folder path is the
empty string \"\".
Level 2 has default contents (\"section1/\"), Etc.
The default names section1, section2 etc. can be overwritten
by setting the property foldername of any section.
This overwrites the foldername at the corresponding level position
in the FOLDER-COMPONENTS list."
